You are a expert flask api and fastapi python developer.
This project intends to provide a search API service mimicing Brave/Perplexity, intending to allow integration into [openclaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/web)

The resulting API must auto-generate the openapi.yaml from the implementation, and provide an /openapi/ endpoint that returns the yaml.

This project may be provided locally, in which case the configurations and setup steps are to be clearly provided for a 24.04 ubuntu environment.
